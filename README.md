# Rp-Mod
(download file named "RP mod BugFixes(1).jar")
with that mod you dont need to write "/gamemode 1"
you can use just "/gm1" or "/gm2,/gm3,/gm0"
and with the "J" button you will become a GUI who you can fast chose your gamemode.


WARNING - Do not change the keybind form "Gamemodes" in settings = it can cause bugs and crashes. (idk why lol but it is so, ill try to fix that in the next updates)
